# **Tennis Data Analysis Project**

## **Introduction**
This project focuses on analyzing tennis player and match data scraped from the [SofaScore website](https://www.sofascore.com/). The analysis aims to provide insights into various aspects of professional tennis, including player performance, match statistics, and country-level contributions to the sport.

## **Libraries Used**
The following Python libraries were utilized in this project:
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **numpy**: For numerical computations.
- **matplotlib.pyplot**: For data visualization.
- **seaborn**: For advanced and aesthetically pleasing data visualizations.
- **scipy.stats**: For statistical analysis.
- **geopandas**: For geographic data visualization.

    ## **Resources**

- [Natural Earth Data - 1:110m Cultural Vectors](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/110m-cultural-vectors/)
- [Making Heat Maps with Literal Maps - Towards Data Science](https://towardsdatascience.com/making-heat-maps-with-literal-maps-how-to-use-python-to-construct-a-chloropleth-6b65e4e33905)



## **Analysis Process**
- The dataset was cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and ensure data consistency.
- Descriptive statistics were used to answer numerical and categorical questions.
- Correlation analysis, visualizations, and statistical tests were applied to explore relationships between variables.

## **Visualizations**
To support the analysis, various plots and charts were generated, including:
- Histograms and Boxplots for height of players and Aces of each match.
- Scatter plots to study correlations, such as height versus ranking.
- Bar charts and pie charts for categorical distributions like handedness and court surfaces.

## **Conclusion**
This analysis provided valuable insights into the dataset, answering key questions about player performance, match statistics, and other aspects of tennis. The findings offer a deeper understanding of trends and patterns in professional tennis, which could be useful for fans, analysts, and coaches alike.
